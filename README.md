<h1>Spam Email Classification Project</h1>

The expanding volume of spam emails has created a need for solid spam filtering solutions. Therefore, the purposes of this project are:

   - Use Python based Text Classification technique to classify email spam messages.

   - To find Accuracy, Time, and Error Rate by applying suitable algorithms. Such as Naive Bayes or Naive Bayes Multinomial etc.

   - To compare different algorithms to find the best suitable for text classification

<b>Note:</b> This is a final year project for the Master of Computer Science degree program at Virtual University of Pakistan.

<h3> Deployed App:</h2>

<h3>Testing Samples:</h3>

- <b>Spam Text:
   
```quote
   your microsoft account has been compromised ,you must update your password before or else your account going to close click to update. By doing this we are also going to give you $500 reward from our side into your bank account.
   ```

```quote
Today we want to inform you that the application period for free Google Scholarships in Data Analytics is now open! Please apply by March 30th, 2021 via https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics
```

<h3>Process Model:</h3>
   
Adopted Process Model is VU Process Model which is the combination of Waterfall and Spiral Methodologies. One feature of waterfall methodology is the sequence of steps that we take in our methodology and one feature of spiral methodology is to go previous steps which is also included in our methodology.
